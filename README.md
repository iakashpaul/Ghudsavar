# Ghudsavar 🏇🏻

> Ghudsavar (Horse rider) - Is a quick llama.cpp server for CPU only runtimes, made available as a docker image. Duplicate this [🤗 HF-space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/iAkashPaul/Ghudsavar) as your own CPU/GPU space & change the model weights to your own GGUF file. BTW the free tier with 2 CPU-cores runs between 5-8tok/s with Gemma-2B-Instruct@Q8, which is alright for quick testing.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iakashpaul/Ghudsavar.git
cd Ghudsavar
docker build -t iakashpaul/Ghudsavar:latest .
```
